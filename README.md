## About the Project
**SIMPLE CALCULATOR**

Create a simple calculator using the following:

    1. The application will ask the user to choose one of the four math operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division)

    2. The application will ask the user for two numbers

    3. Display the result

    4. The application will ask if the user wants to try again or not.

    5. If yes, repeat Step 1.

    6. If no, Display “Thank you!” and the program will exit 

    7. Use Python Function and appropriate Exceptions to capture errors during runtime.

## About the Program
**STEPS**

1. Define functions for the operations.

2. Ask how many numbers will be calculated. the length of the code will depend on the number of items it can process.

3. For 2-items, show the choices for operations and ask the user their choice.

4. Use if-elif statements and use the defined operations to execute the calculations and print the answer right away.

5. Ask if there are more calculations and give corresponding answer to when there are more and there are none.

6. For 3-items, repeat process with 2-items except that the operations are more complex than before.

## Running the Program

1. Put the number of items to be calculated. In this case, only 2 or 3 items can be processed.

2. Put the number of choices according to the list given.

3. Put the numbers that are to be calculated. Press enter and you will get the answer right away.

4. Put whether you are going to calculate more or not. If there are none put 'n', or else put anything to continue computing.
